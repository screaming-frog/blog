    "Sometimes, the anonynimity of the internet relieves whatever societal pressure skewing the battle between superego and id, causing the cesspits we see on Twitter, Reddit, and any other place people talk to each other. I wanted to do something about the rage-inducing interactions between two people who see each other as faceless 'others' where people dehumanise others for not sharing their viewpoint and are, therefore, morons.\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought a good idea would be to put my natural language processing (NLP) skillset into use. Have you ever heard of the saying 'you can't win a fight against a heavy bag'? Well what about if the heavy bag could also goad you into a fight as well as hit back? My plan was to finetune a medium sized GPT-2 model such that it could argue with people coherently online and place this model inside bots that could interact with Twitter and Reddit like I'm a modern day Rabbi Loew. By siccing my golems on people who are engaged in flame wars and making the existence of these bots known, I hope to discourage excessive toxicity and raise awareness. After all, if the idiot you're arguing with might be a pile of linear algebra, what's the point in getting angry.\n",

    "## The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using GPT-2 a transformer model developed by OpenAI using generative pretraining to allow for unsupervised training on text. So similarly to how convolutional neural networks can be pretrained on ImageNet or some large image dataset and finetuned on a much smaller dataset, GPT-2 does the same for language. The objective during pretraining is to simply predict the next word given the preceding text. This is useful because text is rather abundant and usually unlabelled. For more information, read the original paper https://cdn.openai.com/better-language-models/language_models_are_unsupervised_multitask_learners.pdf or one of the multitude of blog posts on the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "During finetuning, the model is given a comment and the objective is to iteratively predict the next word in the response to the comment until the \"&lt; endoftext>\" token is predicted, denoting the end of the response."

This could be parsed properly, cleaned up and included but there's such an abundance of data that it's not necessary. Then it's just cleaning up some '\\n' newline characters and random slashes.
